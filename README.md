# Aegleseeker | Mousey v2

### Instructions for running.
Install npm from this site: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Download the entire project.

Open the command line and go to the directory of the folder. (Ask Lily if you don't know how to)

Run `installdependencies.bat`. After that, run `start.bat`.

`./src/config.json` is a vital part of this bot. It consists of:
```
{
    "env": {
        "prefix": "[insert prefix]",
        "token": "[bot token]",
        "saucenao": "[saucenao API]"
    }
}
```
Talk to Lilyn for the config.json for her bot.
